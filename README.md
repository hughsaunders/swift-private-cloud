Description
===========

Installs packages and configuration for OpenStack Swift in the Private
Cloud.  This is a highly opinionated configuration of swift.  It
likely is not suitable for you.

A better choice might be wrapping or builing around
https://github.com/rcbops-cookbooks/swift-lite, a non-opinionated bare
bones swift install.

That's what this cookbook is, essentially, a opinionation wrapper
around swift-lite.

Requirements
============

Client:
 * CentOS >= 6.3
 * Ubuntu >= 12.04

Chef:
 * >= 0.11

Other variants of Ubuntu and Fedora may work, something crazy like
Solaris probably will not.  YMMV, objects in mirror, etc.

This differs from the rcbops OpenStack Swift cookbooks in that it
tries to do much less with the swift cluster.  Specifically:

 * It does not do swath auth.  It just does keystone.

 * It does not do ring management, or set up a repo for storing rings in.

 * It does not do drive detection, formatting, mounting or unmounting

Generally this means that it does not do things that could potentially
cause cluster data loss, preferring to leave that to experienced
system administrators.

This cookbook leverages the rcbops swift-lite cookbook to do the heavy
swift lifting.
